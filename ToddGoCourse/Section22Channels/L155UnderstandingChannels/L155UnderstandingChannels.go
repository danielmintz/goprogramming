// channels  block
// they are like runners in a relay race
// they are synchronized
// they have to pass/receive the value at the same time
// just like runners in a relay race have to pass / receive the baton to each other at the same time
// one runner can’t pass the baton at one moment
// and then, later, have the other runner receive the baton
// the baton is passed/received by the runners at the same time
// the value is passed/received synchronously; at the same time
// channels allow us to pass values between goroutines
